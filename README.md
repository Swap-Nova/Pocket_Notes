This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Building a Notes App: 
* To build a full-stack project out of this we are going to use pocketbase.io which is a real-time embedded performant database with schemar builder, data validataion and work with RESTapi.

### What is Pocket base?
* PocketBase is an open source backend consisting of embedded database (SQLite) with realtime subscriptions, built-in auth management, convenient dashboard UI and simple REST-ish API.
* We have to download pocketbase in our project folder, specifically the folder must contain pocketbase.exe file. 
* To run the pocket base, in terminal type:
```bash
./pocketbase serve
```

* In that you can add database field like adding title and for now set the ‘API Rules’ for admins only.

### After running the server:

### Creating a Dynamic route:
* In the component of the notes/page.tsx file we are linking note with an random id which is generated by pocketbase.
* So we will create an [id] folder that is surrounds by brackets. It will tell next that it is an wildcard and can be any value.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
